"""Create an executable file for this app. The executable file will be ready to use by anybody who has the exe file and not necesary a version of python installed"""
#install pyinstaller (pip )
#in the command line just type pyinstaller <file_name>
#to be practical pass a parameter to the pyinstaller: pyinstaller --onefile <file_name>
#even more, if you don't want the cmd line to be shown in the background of the GUI, use the --windowed param
#pyinstaller --onefile --windowed <file_name>
